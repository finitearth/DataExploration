This assignment is part of our course Data Exploration. The task is to create a classifier, predicting which pumps are non-functional.
Part of it was the data analysis, feature engineering and the creation, as well as the evaluation of algorithms.
We achieved an Area-Under-RO-Curve of 0.92, which is the maximum achievable score.
